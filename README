This version of mdtest incorporates an S3 Interface.  S3 is conditionaly compiled 
based on the _HAS_S3 directive.  This directive along with reguired compile flags 
are contained in the environment variable MDTEST_FLAGS.  

mdtest version 1.9.3 was used as the basis for this modification.  The basic 
methodology was to modify all file/dir create, stat, and deletes to a 
bucket/object create stat and delete structure.  s3_mdtest uses a forked modified 
version of vladistan/aws4c to create and configure the correct Amazon Web Services 
header to eventually target an S3 based platform.  As of this writing the forked 
version has a pull request against the master.  The forked, modified version is 
currently residing in jti-lanl/aws4c.


MDTEST_FLAGS must contain Include and LIB paths for the required linked in library,
aws4c.  In addition, the xml2 and curl libs must be linked in.  

Here is an example of the MDTEST_FLAGS env variable:

export MDTEST_FLAGS=_I /path/to/aws4c/include -L /path/to/aws4c/lib -laws4c_extra \
-laws4c -lcurl -lxml2

After setting MDTEST_FLAGS appropriately, make is run to create the executable


Two new arguments must be set to run mdtest against the S3 target, they are:

-a userid for S3 target
-A hostname or IP address of S3 target

This version does NOT require a target path (-d) as it takes of all 
bucket and object naming on the S3 target.
